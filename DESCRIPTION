Description: Automated quantification of an individual tree plagiotropic vs. orthotropic growth orientation, using TLS point cloud. These data may be usefull in several ecological contexts, e.g., assessment of: tree/forest structural diversity; tree architecture convergence/divergence; water management by tree branching systems; light exploitation and space exploration potential.
